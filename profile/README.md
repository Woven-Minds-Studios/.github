  <h1>Woven Minds Studios</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the official GitHub organization for Woven Minds Studios, developers of the psychological horror MMO "Woven Thoughts".</p>
  <p></p>We're a small, passionate team building an immersive world where abstract concepts gain physical form and hunt their thinkers.</p>

## üåê Our Vision

We're creating a unique MMO experience that blends psychological horror with innovative gameplay mechanics centered around thought manifestation. In our world, thinking the wrong thought can create entities that hunt you, memories can be stolen, and identity is something to be protected at all costs.

Our goal is to deliver a game that:
- Creates genuine unease through psychological horror rather than just jump scares
- Offers unique gameplay mechanics where mental states affect the world
- Builds a community around shared experiences of horror and survival
- Pushes the boundaries of what an MMO can be
- Maybe even pull some heart strings along the way
